.. py:class:: Parameters

   Bases: :py:obj:`types.SimpleNamespace`


   A container for parameters used in a report.

   An instance of this class is returned by the `orderly.parameters` function.
   Individual parameters can be accessed as fields of the object.

   Example:

       >>> params = orderly.parameters(p=1)
       >>> params.p
       1


.. py:function:: parameters(**kwargs) -> Parameters

   Declare parameters used in a report.

   Parameters
   ----------
   kwargs :
     Keyword mappings of parameter names to default values (or to None
     if no default is given)

   Returns
   -------
   The parameters that were passed to the report. If running outside of an
   orderly context, this returns kwargs unmodified.


.. py:function:: resource(files)

   Declare that a file, or group of files, are an orderly resource.

   By explicitly declaring files as resources, orderly will mark the
   files as immutable inputs and validate that your analysis does not
   modify them with 'orderly.run'.

   Parameters
   ----------
   files : str|Path or [str|Path]

   Returns
   -------
   Nothing, this is called for its side effects within a running packet



.. py:function:: shared_resource(files: str | list[str] | dict[str, str]) -> dict[str, str]

   Copy shared resources into a packet directory.

   You can use this to share common resources (data or code) between multiple
   packets. Additional metadata will be added to keep track of where the files
   came from. Using this function requires the shared resources directory
   `shared/` exists at the orderly root; an error will be
   raised if this is not configured when we attempt to fetch files.

   Parameters
   ----------
   files: str | [str] | dict[str, str]
       The shared resources to copy. If a dictionary is provided, the keys will
       be the destination file while the value is the filename within the
       shared resource directory.

   Returns
   -------
       A dictionary of files that were copied. If a directory was copied, this
       includes all of its individual contents. Do not rely on the ordering
       where directory expansion was performed, as it may be platform
       dependent.


.. py:function:: artefact(name, files)

   Declare an artefact.

   By doing this you turn on a number of orderly features:

   (1) Files that are artefacts will not be copied from the src
   directory into the draft directory unless they are also listed as
   a resource by 'orderly.resource'

   (2) If your script fails to produce these files, then
   `orderly.run` will fail, guaranteeing that your task really does
   produce the things you need it do.

   (3) Within the final metadata, your artefacts will have additional
   metadata; the description that you provide and a grouping.

   Parameters
   ----------
   description : str
       The name of the artefact

   files : str or [str]
       The file, or array of files, that make up this artefact. These
       are relative paths.

   Returns
   -------
   Nothing, this is called for its side effects within a running packet


.. py:function:: description(*, display=None, long=None, custom=None)

   Describe the current report.

   Parameters
   ----------
   display : str
     A friendly name for the report; this will be displayed in some
     locations of the web interfaces, packit.

   long : str
     A longer description, perhaps a sentence or two.

   custom : dict
     Any additional metadata. Must be a dictionary with string keys
     and string, number or boolean values.

   Returns
   -------
   Nothing, this is called for its side effects within a running packet


.. py:function:: dependency(name, query, files)

   Declare a dependency on another packet.

   Parameters
   ----------
   name: str | None
     The name of the packet to depend on, or None

   query: str
     A search query for packets, as a string. For example, "latest",
     "latest(parameter:x == 'value')" or "20230807-152344-ee606dce"

   files: str | [str] | dict[str, str]
     Files to use from the dependent packet

   Returns
   -------
   Data on the resolved dependency; this is an `orderly.helpers.Plan` object,
   which contains elements `id`, `name` and `files`
