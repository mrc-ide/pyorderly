.. py:function:: parse_ssh_url(url)

   Parse the URL of an SSH location.

   URLs have the form `ssh://username@hostname:port/path`. The username and
   port number are optional. By default, the path is interpreted as relative
   to the remote user's home directory. In order to use an absolute path on
   the remote server, an additional forward slash must be used, eg.
   `ssh://hostname//foo/bar`.

   Bases: :py:obj:`pyorderly.outpack.location_driver.LocationDriver`

   before and after its methods are called.
